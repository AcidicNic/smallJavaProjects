### idleClickerGame
An unfinished game I made 2 years ago, it sort of works. 
### BruteForce.java & CrackTheCode.java
This makes a list of every 4 character 0-9, A-Z, a-z combination and sorts through them until a specific combination is found. You can pick the combination or a random one can be generated for you. CrackTheCode does the same thing but it's not as good.
